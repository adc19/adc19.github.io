## Introduction

With the advent of Quantum Computing, certaing cryptographic algorithms will become absolute or weakened as quantum computers will be able to perform the complex cryptanalysis calculations much more quickly than today's standard of computers.

Though, it will take much more time before quantum computers become practical or available to well-founded or national threat-actors, we need to plan for the deprecation of traditional cryptographic schemes.  

We need to work on creating cryptographic mechanisms capable of operating on current traditional computers and also able to resist attacks from both present and future computers, this is known as Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC). But fortunately for most of us we don't need to invent these algorithms, instead we just need to ensure that we are in a position to use these algorithms whenever they become mature enough. 

There are generally three types of data which needs to secured
- Data at Rest
- Data in Transit
- Long-lived Document Signing

In the next sections we will be discussing how to make these data ready for PQC.

## Data at Rest


## Data in Transit
